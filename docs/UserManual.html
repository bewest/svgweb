HTML Reference

    HTML Example:
        <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
                codebase="" id="mySVGViewerObj" width=1250.0 height=750.0 style='float: left'>
            <param name=movie value="svgviewer.swf">
            <param name="FlashVars" value="sourceType=url_svg&svgURL=scimitar.svg">
            <param name="wmode" value="transparent">
            <embed play=false name="mySVGViewerObj" 
                    src="svgviewer.swf" quality=high wmode="transparent"
                    width=1250.0 height=750.0 type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
                    FlashVars="sourceType=url_svg&svgURL=scimitar.svg">
            </embed >
        </object>

    The following parameters are valid for HTML. That means they can be
    passed directly to flash with the "FlashVars" parameter.
        uniqueId, sourceType, svgURL, svgId, scaleMode,
        translateX, translateY, scaleX, scaleY

Javascript Reference

    svgviewer:
        The svgviewer object represents the top level entry point
        into the svgviewer javascript library. You use the createSVG
        method to place SVG files in your web page.

    svgviewer.createSVG(params)
        Example:
        <div id = 'mySVGDiv'><!--SVG will go here --></div>
        <script type='text/javascript'>
        svgviewer.createSVG({ parentId: 'mySVGDiv',
                              sourceType: "url_svg",
                              svgURL: "scimitar.svg"
                            });
        </script>


            This method is used to create the html for the SVG file you wish
        to place on your web page. You pass the ID of the parent element
        (typically a <div>) and it adds the image to the parent element.
        The library currently removes existing children of the parent element
        before adding the html necessary to display the svg.

    createSVG parameter values:
        uniqueId: optional parameter
            type: string
            default value:
                If you do not specify a unique id, a random one is
                chosen for you.

            A name used for referencing the SVG image which is useful if you load
            multiple SVG images.
       
        sourceType:
            parameter kind: required parameter
            type: string
            default value: none
            Allowable Values:
                "url_svg":
                       The SVG is located in an SVG file at the URL specified by the svgURL parameter.
                "string":
                       The SVG is located in the svgString parameter.
                "url_script":
                       The SVG is located within script tags in a file located
                       by the svgURL paremeter. The script tag needs to have an
                       id specified by the svgId parameter.
                "inline_script":
                       The SVG is located within script tags inline with the
                       current HTML file. The script tag needs to have an id
                       specified by the svgId parameter.

        svgURL:
            parameter kind: required parameter
            type: string
            default value: none
            Examples: "foo.svg", "http://some.example.com/foo.svg"
 
        svgId: required parameter when the sourceType parameter is set to
               "inline_script" or "url_script".
            type: string
            default value: none

            This is used when the sourceType parameter is set to "inline_script"
            or "url_script".

        svgString:
            type: string
            default value: none
            Specifies the starting SVG XML string to use for creating the SVG
            object.
            Example: "<svg></svg>"
            Note: currently only supported via javascript to flash messaging.
            See the Developers Manual.

        renderer:
            parameter kind: optional
            type: string
            default value: "svgviewer"

            Specifies the renderer(s) for the svg source in order of preference.
            Renderers should be seperated by ",". See examples below.
            Currently svgviewer (the flash renderer) is always assumed to be
            installed and is the default renderer when all specified renderers 
            are unavailable.

            Allowable Values:
                "<renderer>[:<renderer>]*" where <renderer> is one of:
                    "native":
                        Rendered by the browser by creating an <svg> tag.
                        If the browser does not support svg natively, then the
                        the next renderer in the list is used.
                    "plugin": (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
                        Rendered by the Adobe SVG viewer plugin. If this is
                        not installed, proceed to the next renderer.
                    "svgviewer":
                        Rendered by flash using the svgviewer swf object.
                    
                Examples:
                    "native,plugin"
                    "native,plugin,svgviewer"
                    "plugin,svgviewer"
                    "native,svgviewer"
                    "native"

                    Note that the first two and last two examples above are
                    equivalent because "svgviewer" is always assumed to be
                    the last renderer in the list. If specified (which is
                    unnecessary) "svgviewer" should always be last because
                    it is assumed to always be present and so any other
                    renderers following it will be ignored.


        width:
            parameter kind: optional
            type: number
            Specifies the width of the html object.

        height:
            type: number
            Specifies the height of the html object.

        sizeToSVG:
            type: boolean
            Specifies whether the javascript library should resize the html
            object to the width and height of the svg file as specified
            within the file itself. If this is set to true, this resizing
            will occur when the file is loaded.

            See FAQ Issue.1: Why is there a flicker when the SVG is first
            rendered?
            Flicker at the end of the initial rendering can occur if you
            use automatic resizing. To avoid this, make sure to specify an
            object 'width' and 'height' with your createSVG parameters and
            leave the "sizeToSVG" parameter set to false. If you do not
            specify width or height, or if you set sizeToSVG to true, then
            svgviewer assumes you want the html object to have the same
            height and width as the SVG file. However, it does not know what
            the size of the SVG file is until it loads it. Before it is
            loaded, the object has to have some height and width. If you do
            not tell svgviewer what size to use, the object
            will have a width and height of 2048 and 1024 respectively. Once
            the SVG file is loaded, it resizes to the correct size.

            Here is how automatic resizing works.  After the svg image is
            loaded, flash tells javascript what the height and width of the
            SVG file is (which it gets from the top <svg> tag). Javascript
            then resizes the object by changing the width and height
            attributes of the html object. When this occurs, flash receives
            a resize event and then it transforms the image to fit in the
            new area.  In the brief moment between when the object resizes
            and when flash resizes, the image will be off center and that
            results in a "herky jerky" effect. To avoid that, the image is
            briefly hidden and then unhidden using html styles. When it is
            unhidden, it will not be off center because flash will have
            already repositioned by then. It only takes a moment for flash
            to reposition.  This hide and unhide causes the flicker. Another
            alternative is to not display anything until the entire object is
            drawn and resized properly. This is probably the most technically
            correct behavior.

            However, for large SVG files, delaying visibility results in
            absolutely no drawing feedback to the user for possible a very
            long time. For now, this will not be the behavior. You can
            simulate this behavior by using a width and height of 1, but be
            sure the SVG file has a height and width (which is not a %), or
            else it will not resize any bigger! A future setting will allow
            choosing between "hide for resize" (the current default),
            "herky jerky", and "hide until done." The goal is to add a
            progress indicator for drawing large files, in which case it
            would then be acceptable to make "hide until done" the future
            default for this setting.
            Note: does not apply to native rendering.

        scaleMode:
            type: string
            default value: "showAll_svg"
            Allowable values: "showAll_svg", "showAll", "exactFit", "noBorder", "noScale"

        translateX:
            type: number
            default value: 0
            Note: does not apply to native rendering.

        translateY:
            type: number
            default value: 0
            Note: does not apply to native rendering.

        scaleX:
            type: number
            default value: 1.0
            Note: does not apply to native rendering.

        scaleY:
            type: number
            default value: 1.0
            Note: does not apply to native rendering.

        bgcolor:
            type: string
            Specifies the background color.

        transparent:
            Specifies whether the flash control should be transparent. This
            allows overlapping html and other flash controls. Note this does
            not appear to be functional on linux.

        debug:
            type: boolean
            Specifies whether the flash control and javascript should output
            debug messages.  Note that the easiest way to see these messages
            is to use Firefox and install the firebug extension.

        onLoad:
            type: function
            Specifies a function to call back to when the SVG file is loaded.
            The reason for providing this is that the current svgviewer
            javascript API combines the step of creating and loading the SVG
            file, so there is no opportunity to add an onload handler.
            This may change in the future if the createDocument method is
            supported.


            onLoad callback example:
                function onLoadCallback(flashMsg) {
                    return;
                }



    Examples:

    <div id = 'mySVGDiv'><!--SVG will go here --></div>
    <script type='text/javascript'>
    svgviewer.createSVG({ uniqueId: 'scimitar1',
                          parentId: 'mySVGDiv',
                          sourceType: "url_svg",
                          svgURL: "scimitar.svg",
                          debug: true,
                          bgcolor: '#ffffff',
                          transparent: false,
                          width: 1250.0,
                          height: 750.0,
                          translateX: 0, translateY: 0,
                          scaleX: 1.0, scaleY: 1.0
                        });
    </script>
