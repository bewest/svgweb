Basic
    Basic.1: What is SVGViewer?
        SVGViewer is a flash "movie" which renders Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files.

    Basic.2: What is an SVG file? Where can I get SVG files?
        Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files are graphical images that are stored in XML format.
        Vector graphics can scale to any size without degradation unlike bitmap images which become pixelated.
        You can find many freely available SVG files at http://www.openclipart.org.
        You can use the freely available Inkscape application to create and edit SVG files.

    Basic.3: Why does SVGViewer exist?
        Internet Explorer does not support SVG files. An option to support SVG on Internet Explorer
        was desired that did not require the user to install anything.  Adobe has provided a plug-in but it
        requires installation and is scheduled for end of support. So, this flash shim was created to allow
        any browser with flash support to support SVG files without installing anything else.

    Basic.4: Who wrote SVGViewer?
        The original core was written by James Hight and released under MIT license in September of 2008.
        Rick Masters took that code and created a new project, http://code.google.com/p/sgweb,
        on October 11th, 2008. Rick then added support for linear and radial gradients, xlink cross
        references, gaussian blurs, and javascript scripting and fixed numerous minor issues.
        Rick can be contacted here: grick23 at gmail.com.

    Basic.6: What is sgweb?
        sgweb is the project that Richard Masters started as an umbrella project for scalable graphics
        utilities for web browsers. Simply put: sgweb is the parent project for svgviewer.
        The sgweb project seeks to promote vector markup languages in web browsers and is agnostic
        on technology. The first utility of this project is svgviewer. There may be other utilities
        added to the sgweb project for Xaml, javafx, and other markup languages in the future.

Deployment
    Dep.1: What is the simplest way to include an SVG image on my web page?
        See examples/svg_loadfile_js.html
        Place svgviewer.swf in the same directory as your html file.

    Dep.2: How can I use an SVG image from SVG content that is stored inline in my web page?
        See examples/svg_inline.html
        Place svgviewer.swf in the same directory as your html file.

    Dep.3: How can I include an SVG image on my web page without using javascript?
        See examples/svg_loadfile_obj.html
        Place svgviewer.swf in the same directory as your html file.

    Dep.4: How can I include multiple inline SVG images?
        See examples/svg_inline_multi.html
        Place svgviewer.swf in the same directory as your html file.

Sizing
    Size.1: What is the relationship between SVG drawing coordinates and
            browser pixel coordinates?
            The SVG drawing coordinates are draw initially to the flash
            coordinate system which are then mapped to browser coordinates.
            SVGViewer tells flash at compile time what the size of the "movie"
            is. The width and height of the flash area is defined at the top
            of SVGViewer.as in the [SWF] directive. Currently, this is 2048
            by 1024.
            When you use svgviewer in your web page you specify a height and
            width (either in the <object> tag or by passing in parameters to
            javascript functions) and then the flash coordinates are mapped
            into that height and width.
            If you specify a width and height of an SVG object as 512 by 256,
            then the image will appear four times smaller than would be
            rendered by SVG if loaded natively by the browser. 
       


Limitations

    Limit.1: What parts of SVG are not implemented?
        * Compressed SVG files are not supported.
        * Scripting is not yet supported.
        * Animation is not yet supported.
        * Only the gaussian blur filter is implemented. No plan to support other filters (which are rarely used).
        * Off center radial gradients (which are rarely used) are not yet supported.
        * SVG Masks (which are rarely used) are not supported. As a best effort, clipping paths
               are used in their place. No plans to support further.
        * Patterns (which are rarerly used) are not supported. No plan to support at this time.


Scripting

    Script.1: What javascript helper functions are available for loading SVG content?
        sgweb.createSVGFlashObject(parentDivId, uniqueId, objectWidth, objectHeight, svgId, bgcolor, scaleX, scaleY, translateX, translateY)
        sgweb.loadSVGURL()

    Script.2: What javascript methods are available as part of the standard W3C SVG interface?
        (note these are not yet implemented)
        createAttributeNS
        createElementNS
        getAttributeNodeNS
        getAttributeNS
        getElementsByTagNameNS
        getNamedItemNS
        hasAttributeNS
        removeAttributeNS
        removeNamedItemNS
        setAttributeNS
        setAttributeNodeNS
        setNamedItemNS

        Example:
            var svgNS = 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg';
            var foo_g = createElementNS(svgNS, 'g')
            foo_g.getAttributeNS(null, 'x');
            foo_g.setAttributeNS(svgNS, 'x', '100');


    Script.3: How are mouse and keyboard events handled?
        There are methods for event registration.
        Mouse Events
        Key Events


Future
    Future.1: What are the plans for SVGViewer?
        The current author tends to work on specific SVG files until they render as well as possible, fixing
        or implementing new functionality along the way. Currently all files render well. If you have an SVG file
        that you would like me to work on, send it to grick23@gmail.com.
        The current task list, as of Nov 28 2008, is:
          1. Implement javascript scripting in order to support svgtetris.svg
          2. Implement animation
