<h1>Developer Notes</h1>
<p>
To build, you will have to pull from Subversion.


<pre><code>
svn checkout http://svgweb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ svgweb-read-only
</code></pre>

<p>Building is currently done consistently on Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
<p>Windows XP is reported to build, but with some issues,
using "MingW and msys" (see Issue 176 comment #4).</p>

<p>
You need the flex/flash SDK, the java runtime*, and the java sdk**.
</p>
<p>
Respectively, that means mxmlc, java, and javac should be in your path.
</p>

<p>
*If you do not compress the javascript, you do not need the java
runtime</p>
<p>**You can comment out the webserver.jar target if you have a web server
and then you do not need the java sdk.</p>


<p>Change to the top level directory where the Makefile is.</p>

<p>
To clobber the build:</p>

<pre><code>
make clean</code></pre>

<p>
To make a build:</p>

<pre><code>
make all</code></pre>

<p>To control whether the JS is compressed (by default it is not):</p>

<pre><code>
make all COMPRESS=1</code></pre>

<p>
To control whether tests are copied into the build/ directory (not copied by default;
these are located in tests/).</p>

<pre><code>
make all COPY_TESTS=1</code></pre>

<p>
Once building you will need to access things using the local web server as normal in
build/. See the Quick Start guide for details on running the 
provided java webserver.</p>

<p>If you have your own web server, you can run the following command, which will copy
files to your web server directory. Substitute the appropriate directory for your system below.</p>


<pre><code>
make install SVGSRV=/var/www/html</code></pre>
