svgviewer.swf is a flash "movie" used to support SVG (scalable vector graphics) files.

Only partial support is implemented at this time. See the example html files in
this directory.

You can specify the URL of an SVG image to load via an HTML parameter, or via the
javascript interface.

Alternatively, you can use javascript to directly pass it the SVG xml content as
a string. So, the SVG content can come from anywhere. The svg_inline.html file in
this directory shows how to put SVG inline with the html.

Alternatives:
There are also browser plug ins and direct browser support for SVG. However, IE does
not support SVG and so this control may be used for simple SVG files as a quick and
dirty alternative, benefiting from the higher installation base that flash enjoys
on IE.
