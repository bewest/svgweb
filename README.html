svgviewer.swf is a flash "movie" for SVG (scalable vector graphics) files.

See the FAQ file docs/FAQ.html for general information.

See the User Manual docs/UserManual.html for details on how to use svgviewer.

To see a sample SVG file, change directory to the html directory and load
one of the html files in your browser. For demo.html, you will need to copy
the svg files from samples directory into the html directory.

If this is a source distribution, the actionscript 3.0 source code is located in
the com/sgweb/svg directory.
